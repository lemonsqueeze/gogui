<section>
<title>Slow navigation to end or beginning of game</title>
<para>
This happens while going forward or backward for a large number of moves in a
game.
Since Java offers no stream selectors for file streams, GoGui needs to use
thread synchronization to read the output and error stream of the Go program
for preserving the correct order of the received output in the GTP shell and
for detecting timeouts.
This synchronization can become slow if there are other CPU intensive
background processes running on the computer.
The problem can be avoided if the Go engine implements the
<command>gg-undo</command> and <command>gogui-play_sequence</command> commands
(see <xref linkend="compatibility"/>), then a single command can replace up to
several hundred <command>play</command> or <command>undo</command> commands.

<title>Standard error and output of the GTP engine are displayed in wrong order</title>
<para>
Due to deficiencies in the Java library, it cannot be guaranteed that the
standard error and standard output of the GTP engine are always displayed in
the correct order in the GTP shell. In cases where the order is critical for
debugging purposes, it is better to invoke GoGui from a terminal with the
<option>-verbose</option> option and watch the logging of the GTP streams
in the terminal.
